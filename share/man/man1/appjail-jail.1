.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Sy appjail jail
utility creates, removes, lists, configures or basically can manage many things
related to jails and their properties.
.Xr appjail-quick 1
uses it to create, remove, and mark them as dirty.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Cm boot Oo Cm off Ns | Ns Cm on Oc Ar jail
Enable
.Pq Cm on
or disable
.Pq Cm off
the boot flag for
.Ar jail
.Ns "."
If the boot flag is enabled,
.Xr appjail-startup 1
will start and/or stop
.Ar jail
.Ns ,
a process commonly performed by the
.Xr rc 8
script.
.It Cm clean
Remove dirty jails.
.It Cm create Oo Fl a Ar architecture Oc Oo Fl I Ar install-method Oc Oo Fl i Ar initscript Oc Oo Fl r Ar release Oc Oo Fl T Ar type Oc Oo Fl t Ar template Oc Oo Fl v Ar version Oc Ar jail
Create a new jail. This subcommand only has the responsibility of creating a jail;
It is highly recommended to use
.Xr appjail-quick 1
unless you know what you are doing.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl a Ar architecture
Specify the architecture to use in the jail. If this option is not set, the architecture
specified by the
.Sy FREEBSD_ARCH
parameter is used.
.It Fl I Ar install-method
Specify the installation method that affects the jail type and how you should use
this subcommand. If this option is not set, the installation method
specified by the
.Sy DEFAULT_INSTALL_METHOD
parameter is used.
.Pp
See
.Sx INSTALLATION METHODS
for a list of available installation methods.
.It Fl i Ar initscript
.Sy InitScript
to make the jail interactive.
.It Fl r Ar release
Specify the release to use in the jail. If this option is not set, the release
specified by the
.Sy DEFAULT_RELEASE
parameter is used.
.It Fl T Ar type
Type on which the jail is based. The default is
.Sy thin "."
.It Fl t Ar template
Template file. If not specified, the template file specified by the
.Sy DEFAULT_TEMPLATE
parameter is used.
.It Fl v Ar version
Specify the version of the operating system to use in the jail. If this option is not set, the version
specified by the
.Sy FREEBSD_VERSION
parameter is used.
.El
.It Cm destroy Oo Fl fR Oc Ar jail
Destroy
.Ar jail
.Ns "."
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl f
Forcibly unmount file system. Ignored when ZFS is not enabled.
.It Fl R
Recursively destroy all dependents, including cloned file systems outside the target
hierarchy. Ignored when ZFS is not enabled.
.El
.It Cm get Oo Fl eHIpt Oc Ar jail Oo Ar keyword Ns " " Ns "..." Oc
Get information about
.Ar jail
.Ns , that is, the
.Ar keyword
that represent the information to be obtained. Multiple keywords can be specified,
which are displayed as a table-like interface in the order in which they are specified.
.No If no Ar keyword No is specified, the defaults are Sy status Ns , Sy name Ns , Sy type Ns , Sy version Ns , Sy ports No and Sy network_ip4 Ns "."
.Pp
See
.Sx KEYWORDS
for a list of available keywords.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl e
Not required when using
.Fl p
.Ns "."
The
.Sy \et
character is used to delimit columns,
so as not to show strange values, this option shows
.Sy <TAB>
instead of
.Sy \et
in the case that a value contains the latter.
.It Fl H
Shows the name of the columns.
.It Fl I
Include empty values. By default, a minus sign is displayed when a value is empty.
.It Fl p
Columnate the list.
.It Fl t
Tabulate columns and values.
.El
.It Cm list Oo Fl eHIpt Oc Oo Fl j Ar jail Oc Oo Ar keyword Ns " " Ns "..." Oc
.No Similar to Cm get No but shows each Ar keyword No for each jail in a nice table.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl e Ns , Fl H Ns , Fl I Ns , Fl p Ns , Fl t
.No All of these options perform the opposite task of the options described in Cm get Ns "."
.It Fl j Ar jail
.No Only show information for Ar jail Ns "."
.El
.It Cm mark Oo Cm clean Ns | Ns Cm dirty Oc Ar jail
.Ar jail
can be marked as
.Cm dirty
.Ns , which is something like an atomic operation. When a jail is marked
.Cm dirty
.Ns ,
.Xr appjail 1
and its subcommands are free to treat the target jail as incomplete and error-prone, so the behavior is typically to destroy it and start over, an operation commonly performed by
.Xr appjail-jail 1 ","
.Xr appjail-quick 1 ","
the
.Cm clean
subcommand, and so on.
.It Cm mark Oo Cm locked Ns | Ns Cm unlocked Oc Ar jail
Used by
.Xr appjail-start 1
to prevent another process from executing it
.Po e.g.: the user spawns a new shell and executes
.Xr appjail-start 1
.Pc
while the first one is still running.
.Pp
Marking
.Ar jail
as
.Cm locked
locks it, but if you try to lock it again it fails unless it is marked as
.Cm unlocked
.Ns "."
.It Cm priority Fl p Ar priority Ar jail
Change the
.Ar priority
for
.Ar jail
.Ns "."
.It Cm rename Ar jail Ar new-name
Rename
.Ar jail
with a new name.
.El

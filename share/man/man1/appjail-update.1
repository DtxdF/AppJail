.Sh NAME
.Nm appjail-update
.Nd Update a thick jail or a release
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm appjail update
.Cm jail
.Op Fl bfKk
.Op Fl j Ar jobs
.Ar jail
.Nm appjail update
.Cm release
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl a Ar arch
.Op Fl v Ar version
.Op Ar release
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Sy appjail update
is a utility to fetch and install updates to a jail or a release.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width -xxx
.It Cm jail Oo Fl bfKk Oc Oo Fl j Ar jobs Oc Ar jail
Update
.Ar jail Ns "."
.Pp
You can only update a thick jail, except when it comes from an empty release.
.Pp
This subcommand updates a thick jail using
.Xr freebsd-update 8
.Pq binary updates
or using the FreeBSD source tree
.Po source updates Pc Ns ;
However, it depends entirely on how this jail was created. For thin jails, it is
not possible to use this subcommand, but there are at least two methods: the first
method uses
.Xr appjail-etcupdate 8
after updating the release that uses the thin jail and the second method is to
separate the data that needs to be persisted from data that is considered ephemeral,
so you can destroy and recreate a jail, but preserving the non-ephemeral data.
.Pp
Note that when the jail comes from a build from the FreeBSD source tree, the release
is linked indirectly. To detect that the jail comes from a build from the FreeBSD
source tree, to obtain the kernel configuration file, architecture, version and other
parameters this subcommand uses the release directory, since those parameters are
stored there. This is important if you want to export the jail and the release on
another system.
.Pp
If
.Ar jail
was created with PkgBase, this subcommand only performs minor updates using
.Xr pkg 8 Ns ,
using the directory containing the
.Xr pkg.conf 5
files, which have already been copied by
.Xr appjail-fetch 1 Ns "."
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl b
Build the world and, if the kernel was compiled successfully when building the release
.Pq and if Fl K No is not specified
or
.Fl k
is specified, the kernel.
.It Fl f
Force
.Xr freebsd-update 8 Cm fetch
to proceed in the case of an unfinished upgrade. Ignored when the jail was created
using a build from the FreeBSD source tree.
.Pp
If the jail was created with PkgBase, then
.Xr pkg-upgrade 8
will force the reinstallation or upgrade of the whole set of packages.
.It Fl K
By default, this subcommand detects whether a kernel has been compiled successfully
when the release is created, so it will proceed to install the kernel again and, if
.Fl b
is specified, it will build the kernel again. This option disables this behavior.
.It Fl k
Build and install the kernel even if it is not necessary, that is, when it was not
compiled correctly or at all when creating the release.
.It Fl j Ar jobs
Number of jobs. If this option is not set, the number of jobs specified by the
.Sy JOBS
parameter is used.
.El
.It Cm release Oo Fl f Oc Oo Fl a Ar arch Oc Oo Fl v Ar version Oc Oo Ar release Oc
Update
.Ar release Ns "."
.Pp
A release cannot be updated if it was created using a build from the FreeBSD source
tree or if it is an empty release. On the one hand, an empty release is assumed to
be the user, you, the only person who knows how to update it, and on the other hand,
to update a release that was created using a build from the FreeBSD source tree,
.Xr appjail-fetch 1
should be used and, if your workflow requires it, you should also use
.Xr appjail-etcupdate 1
and
.Xr appjail-deleteOld 1 "."
.Pp
If
.Ar release
was created with PkgBase, this subcommand only performs minor updates using
.Xr pkg 8 Ns ,
using the directory containing the
.Xr pkg.conf 5
files, which have already been copied by
.Xr appjail-fetch 1 Ns "."
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl f
Force
.Xr freebsd-update 8 Cm fetch
to proceed in the case of an unfinished upgrade.
.Pp
If the release was created with PkgBase, then
.Xr pkg-upgrade 8
will force the reinstallation or upgrade of the whole set of packages.
.It Fl a Ar arch

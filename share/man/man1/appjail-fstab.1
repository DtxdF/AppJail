.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Sy appjail fstab
utility adds, removes, mounts, and lists
.Xr fstab 5
entries. This is all done from the command-line rather than from an
.Xr fstab 5
file, such an interface is advantageous for automation.
.Xr appjail-makejail Ns 's Sy MOUNT No instruction uses this command, for example.
.Pp
Other advantages are that
.Sy appjail fstab
can make changes to
.Ar device
or
.Ar mountpoint
or treat them with special meaning; the pseudo-filesystems described in
.Sx PSEUDO-FILESYSTEMS
are an example. An example of special treatment is that this command allows you to use spaces in
.Ar device
and
.Ar mountpoint Ns ","
which in most cases is not necessary.
.Pp
This command relies on
.Xr appjail-start 1
and the template that the jail uses.
.Xr appjail-start 1
is in charge of calling
.Sy appjail fstab Cm compile
to get an
.Xr fstab 5
file and set
.Sy mount.fstab
to point to that file, but this is not accomplished when the template has
.Sy mount.fstab
set. This design allows the user to use whatever they prefer.
.Pp
Use
.Cm all
to run a command on all jails or
.Cm jail
to run a command on a single jail. If the
.Fl e
parameter of
.Cm all
is specified, this command exits when an error is detected.
.Pp
When no command is specified, the default is
.Cm list Ns , but of course you must use it explicitly if you want to use any of its arguments.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Cm compile
Create an internal fstab(5) file with the entries that are enabled.
.Pp
Depending on
.Ar type Ns ,
this subcommand performs some other tasks while compiling
.Xr fstab 5
entries, but when the file system has no special meaning, it creates a directory
when
.Ar mountpoint
does not exist.
.It Cm get Oo Fl eHIpt Oc Fl n Ar nro Oo Ar keyword Ns " " Ns "..." Oc
Get information about an entry
.Ns , that is, the
.Ar keyword
that represent the information to be obtained. Multiple keywords can be specified,
which are displayed as a table-like interface in the order in which they are specified.
.No If no Ar keyword No is specified, the defaults are Sy nro Ns , Sy enabled Ns ,
.Sy name Ns , Sy device Ns , Sy mountpoint Ns , Sy type Ns , Sy options Ns , Sy dump No and Sy pass Ns "."
.Pp
See
.Sx KEYWORDS
for a list of available keywords.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl e
Not required when using
.Fl p
.Ns "."
The
.Sy \et
character is used to delimit columns,
so as not to show strange values, this option shows
.Sy <TAB>
instead of
.Sy \et
in the case that a value contains the latter.
.It Fl H
Shows the name of the columns.
.It Fl I
Include empty values. By default, a minus sign is displayed when a value is empty.
.It Fl p
Columnate the list.
.It Fl t
Tabulate columns and values.
.El
.It Cm list Oo Fl eHIpt Oc Oo Fl n Ar nro Oc Oo Ar keyword Ns " " Ns "..." Oc
.No Similar to Cm get No but shows each Ar keyword No for each entry in a nice table.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl e Ns , Fl H Ns , Fl I Ns , Fl p Ns , Fl t
.No All of these options perform the opposite task of the options described in Cm get Ns "."
.It Fl n Ar nro
.No Only show information for Ar nro Ns "."
.El
.It Cm mounted
Shows the mounted file systems, except those that are ZFS.
.Pp
It use a right arrow to indicate that
.Ar device
was mounted on
.Ar mountpoint
and a left arrow to indicate that
.Ar mountpoint
was mounted on
.Ar device
.Ns "."
.It Cm mount Oo Ar args Ns " " Ns "..." Oc
Wrapper for
.Xr mount 8
with the
.Fl F
parameter set to the internal
.Xr fstab 5
file.
.Xr mount 8
is run from the host but the working directory is set to the jail directory.
.It Cm remove Oo Cm all Ns | Ns Cm nro Ar nro Oc
Remove a given entry.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Cm all
Remove all entries.
.It Cm nro Ar nro
Remove the entry specified by

Configure a new or existing entry.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl d Ar device
Special device or remote file system to be mounted.
.Pp
If you are configuring an entry that already has this value, it becomes optional,
so you can ignore it if you wish.
.Pp
Depending on
.Ar type Ns , this may have a special meaning. See Sx PSEUDO-FILESYSTEMS Ns "."
.It Fl m Ar mountpoint
Mount point for the file system.
.Pp
If you are configuring an entry that already has this value, it becomes optional,
so you can ignore it if you wish.

.It Oo Fl E Ns | Ns Fl e Oc
Enable

this entry.
.It Fl p
Deprecated. Currently this is a no-op parameter.
.It Fl D Ar dump

.Xr dump 8
command to determine which file systems need to be dumped. The default is
.Sy 0 Ns "."
.It Fl N Ar name
Entry description.
.It Fl n Oo Cm auto Ns | Ns Ar nro Oc
Identifier. An identifier is composed of a positive number. Use
.Cm auto
.Pq default
to get the lowest identifier value.

reboot time. The default is

.Sh PSEUDO-FILESYSTEMS
A pseudo-filesystem, at least in AppJail, is a file system that does not exist on
your system, but performs a specific task. Except for
.Xr nullfs 5 Ns , the following are
considered pseudo-filesystems.
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Sy nullfs
As mentioned,
.Xr nullfs 5
is not a pseudo-filesystem since it exists on your system and can be used via
.Xr mount_nullfs 5 Ns , but it treats Ar device No and Ar mountpoint No with special meaning.
.Pp
If
.Ar device
is a file, an empty file is created and
.Ar mountpoint
is used as the pathname. The same thing happens when
.Ar device
is a directory, but a directory is created instead of a file. An error occurs when
.Ar mountpoint
exists but is not the same file type as
.Ar device Ns "."
.Pp
An error occurs when
.Ar device
does not exist.
.It Sy <pseudofs>
.Sy <pseudofs>
is a pseudo-filesystem that moves files from
.Ar mountpoint
to
.Ar device
before mounting
.Ar device
on
.Ar mountpoint
using
.Xr nullfs 5 "."
The goal is to create the illusion that two directories overlap like
.Xr unionfs 5
does, but we are actually manipulating a single file or directory.
.Pp
The reason to use this pseudo-filesystem is when we need to mount a file or directory
from the host to the jail, but the file or directory inside the jail has content, so
if we simply use
.Sy nullfs Ns ,
the lower layer will
.Dq disappear
when the upper layer is mounted.
.Pp
Before this pseudo-filesystem does its job, it also does what
.Sy nullfs
describes.
.It Sy <volumefs>
.Sy <volumefs>
is a pseudo-filesystem that does what
.Sy <pseudofs>
or
.Sy nullfs
do, plus it can change the
.Sy owner Ns , Sy group No and Sy file mode No of a file or directory. The user creates
a volume using
.Xr appjail-volume 1 Ns , sets the file system type to Sy <volumefs> No and sets the
mountpoint to the volume name;
.Sy appjail fstab
will use the volume name to get the necessary properties such as
.Sy uid Ns , Sy gid Ns , Sy file mode No and Sy mountpoint Ns "."
.Pp
The purpose of this pseudo-filesystem is to take away the responsibility of teaching
the user what properties a mountpoint should have, since applications inside a jail
may have different requirements, it is not feasible for the user to do this job. The
developer of a Makejail, commonly through an image, specifies which volumes the Makejail
should use and the user only needs to know which volume names they should use.
.It Sy nullfs:reverse Ns , Sy <pseudofs>:reverse
Using the
.Sy :reverse
prefix for
.Sy nullfs
and
.Sy <pseudofs>
file systems,
.Ar device
is
.Ar mountpoint
and
.Ar mountpoint
is
.Ar device Ns "."
